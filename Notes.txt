Concatenation - Joining together in JavaScript using the plus (+) operator!

let one = 'Hello, ';
let two = 'how are you?';
let joined = one + two; 
console.log(joined);		Output: 'Hello, how are you?'


Template Literals - Enclosed by the backtick (''). Can contain placeholders. These are
indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}).


Template literals are a quicker way to concatenate text
-you don't have to worry about spacing
-you can embed variables
-the syntax will resemble other lang's like PHP


Normal Concatenation:

const dogName = 'Fluffy';
console.log('My dog, ' + dogName + ', is a great pet!');

// My dog, Fluffy, is a great pet!


Template Literals:

const dogName = 'Fluffy';
console.log(`My dog,${dogName}, is a great pet!`);

// My dog, Fluffy, is a great pet!
